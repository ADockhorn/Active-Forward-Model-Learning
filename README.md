# Active-Forward-Model-Learning
Source code for our paper Active Forward Model Learning submitted to the IEEE Conference on Games 2020

Project Structure:
- *abstractclasses*: includes some helper classes and definitions of the local neighborhood
- *activelearning*: includes the code and data of our experiments
- *activestateexploration*: implementation of state-selection strategies mentioned in the paper and several baseline implementation of RHEA and BFS agents
- *sokoban*: implementation of the game Sokoban

**Notes:**
- all scripts need to be executed from the project folders main directory
- to use the same evaluation data, the respective zip files need to be extracted. Alternatively, the collect_data.py can be executed
